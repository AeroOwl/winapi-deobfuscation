# Towards Generic Deobfuscation of Windows API Calls
## Source code to replicate the data collection process and experimental results

### data_collection
This folder contains the simplified symbolic execution engine and scripts to extract API call information from 32-bit Windows executables; as well as prepare the data to be fed into our HMM-based classifier.

### experiments
This folder has all the code required to replicate both experiments described in the paper. It takes in the data prepared using the scripts from data_collection folder.
