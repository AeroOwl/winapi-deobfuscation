#		results_super_dir: String.
#			Local directory to where results will be sent. 
#		model_type: String 
#			Type of HMM model fit.  Currently only 'Baum-Welch' is supported.  
#			Baum-Welch does a maximum likelihood fit to the dataset.  Later extensions will more completely incorporate VB 
#			and other variants. 
#		default_unlikely_value: Float. 
#			Missing data in the log likelihoods get this number assigned to it, which should be very small.
